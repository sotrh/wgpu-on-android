# Running this project

* This example is currently broken, but I'm uploading it as I try to find a fix for it.

1. Install [cargo-apk](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk) if you haven't already.

```bash
cargo install cargo-apk
```

2. Plugin an Android device with Debug enabled.
3. Build the project

```bash
cargo apk run
```
